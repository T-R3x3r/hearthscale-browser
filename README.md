# Browser

A plugin that browses the web for any app's agent, in the panel's browser tab, and hands a page to the person when it needs them.

Browser is an ordinary Hearthscale app. Nothing in the platform knows its
name; it installs from the Marketplace like any other app.

## Working on it

With a Hearthscale platform running on this machine:

```
hearthscale dev .
```

links this folder into the running platform, picks up every change, and
asks once in the window before any code runs.

## Releasing

Install the Hearthscale registry's GitHub App on this repository once. Then
every release whose tag equals `version` in `app.json` is picked up by the
Marketplace.

```
hearthscale pack .
```

builds the package to attach to the release.

## Licence

MIT. See `LICENSE`.
